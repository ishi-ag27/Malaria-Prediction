# Malaria-Prediction
# Malaria Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project is focused on detecting malaria using deep learning models, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to accurately classify human blood smear images as Malaria Parasitized vs. Uninfected and evaluate the impact of preprocessing on model accuracy.

## Problem Statement

The main objectives of this project are:

1. To develop an accurate and robust deep learning model for classifying blood smear images as Malaria-infected or non-infected.
2. To compare the performance of a VGG19-based transfer learning model with a custom CNN model.

## Dataset

### Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and is designed for detecting malaria using the VGG19 model. It includes microscopic images of blood smears stained with Giemsa, highlighting malaria parasites. The dataset contains two classes:

- "Infected": Blood smear images with malaria parasites.
- "Uninfected": Blood smear images without malaria parasites.

The dataset consists of 27,558 images and serves as a valuable resource for developing a computer vision system for automated malaria diagnosis.
